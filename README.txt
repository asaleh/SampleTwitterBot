This is an experimental bot implemented for a friend for educational reasons. It should
not be used as a tool for spamming. There are no guarantees of any kind for the consequences of
using this software

 It was built using eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, you need java SDK 1.7 to be able
 to compile it. For the ease of use the twitter4j libraries was also added to the libs
 folder (it can be downloaded from http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html).

 TO DOs (for @LeSeverus)
 0- Add user keys for the account to be used for tweeting ( not dynamic signing is implemented)
 1- Implement a way to get a keyword to search for (Main.java)
 2- Implement a way to get the reply that you will use (Main.java)
 3- Implement some way to construct a dynamic tweet for testing (TwitterProcessor.java)
 4- Implement the replying technique (TwitterProcessor.java)

 Good Luck!
